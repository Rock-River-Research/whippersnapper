-------

`whippersnapper` is a python API that allows you to talk directly to your data with natural language. Not only can it understand your questions, it can respond in natural language and provide useful context.

The package is made to be simple. It responds to both questions and commands. It currently works with sql databases, but can be modified to work with pandas dataframes (submit a PR!).
